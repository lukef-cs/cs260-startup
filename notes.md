### React Notes

- **Components**: Building blocks of a React application. They can be functional or class-based.
- **JSX**: JavaScript XML, a syntax extension that allows writing HTML in React.
- **State**: An object that determines how a component renders and behaves.
- **Props**: Short for properties, used to pass data from one component to another.
- **Lifecycle Methods**: Special methods in class components that allow you to run code at particular times in the component's lifecycle (e.g., `componentDidMount`).
- **Hooks**: Functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`).
- **Virtual DOM**: A lightweight copy of the actual DOM that React uses to optimize updates.
